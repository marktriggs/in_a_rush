In A Rush!
==========

This plugin extends the keyboard shortcuts in ArchivesSpace to help
you get around the application quickly.

If you're a die-hard keyboard user, injured your arm in a jousting
accident, or have a broad-spectrum fear of rodents and the things
named after them, this may be the plugin for you.

Features include:

  * Interactive help.  Press `?` anywhere in the application to see
    the list of available keyboard shortcuts.

  * Many keyboard shortcuts, including:

      - Navigation: jump to search, move between search results,
        open/close dropdown menus.

      - Jump straight to create and browse by record type: resources,
        accessions, subjects, agents, digtial objects and top
        containers.

      - Faster record editing: add the major subrecord types with a
        single keystroke, save the current record, close the current
        record.

  * 110% organic, non-GMO and free of dairy, soy and animal
    byproducts.
